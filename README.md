Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain

I am going to build a decentralized voting app. 
This app will have multiple entries against which the user can vote. This app will be unhackable as it is a decentralized app.
I will be using Ethereum blockchain.
Later I will deploy it on Azure Blockchain.

Tools I will be using: Solidity, Smart Contracts, Ethereum Virtual Machine, Azure Blockchain.
